// Single line comments are generally not critical pieces of information. They usually are quick mementos, or tips for your future self.

/* Multi-line comments serve a different purpose (aside from the obvious need to write multiple lines of comments):
 * They are for drawing attention to important stuff; they may explain the reason and/or workings/details of complex algorithms/methods etc.
 *
 * Also, as you can see, we use the asterisk (*) character at the beginning of each line in a multiline comment block. 
 * Also, multiline comments end at the end of the last line, not on the line after the multi-line comment block.
 * Here, we will now end this block at the end of this line ------> */

/* We also use some special keywords in single-line comments for dedicated purposes and use a VSCode extension to specially color & format them.
 * Below are the special comments we use: */
// TODO: This is used to mark-up items of work to complete in the future.
// Info: This is used get the attention of the reader to explain important stuff. IMPORTANT: This generally serves the same purpose as the multi-line comment.
// Why:  This is used to explain the reasoning behind a decision/logic etc.
// Hack: This is used to signal a not-so-optimal solution the writer is not-so-proud-to-explain.
// CALLED BY A UNITY EVENT: Used as a marker for public methods to signal that these methods are invoked from the editor.

// Info: All formatting styles/options permitted by VSCode & Omnisharp are enforced automatically by VSCode every time the code is formatted, as we have our own omnisharp.json file for formatting options in all our Unity projects, tracked via version control.
// Info: There are some formatting options we can not automatically enforce due to limitations of VSCode and/or Omnisharp. These will be explicitly mentioned here.
// Info: When in doubt, check this guide for the formatting style of a specific language feature; Correct format is most probably demonstrated here.

/* List of formatting styles not automatically enforced (Pay attention to these):
 * 1) Angle brackets: There should be spaced inside NON-EMPTY angle brackets. Example: to define a List of Enemies, use List< Enemy >, NOT List<Enemy>.
 * 2) #region declarations: By default VSCode/Omnisharp will move #region declarations to the right and probably align it with the code surrounding it.
 *      This is stupid but expected from both the VSCode and Omnisharp teams. It makes the code harder to read by reducing contrast. Instead, manually indent
 *      regions to the left most column possible. Examples will be presented throughout this guide. */
